*The statement of the Problem* 

The current fraud detection systems in banking rely on manual, rule-based strategies and historical data analysis, which have become increasingly ineffective at identifying modern, sophisticated fraud techniques. These systems also struggle with high false positive rates, leading to disruptions in customer service and operational inefficiencies, while their limited scalability cannot handle the growing volume of digital transactions. Therefore, the proposed machine learning-based fraud detection system will address these issues by significantly improving accuracy, reducing false positives, and providing scalable, real-time detection to better protect against emerging fraud threats, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and customer trust.

           Research objectives 
               General objectives 
To develop a Random Forest model that can accurately determine if a transaction is fraudulent or not. 
               Specific objectives 
               
The objectives of this research project are: 

    i. To determine if transaction type and period of transaction are crucial in detecting fraud.
    
    ii. To develop a random forest model to detect fraudulent transaction.
    
    iii. To evaluate the performance of the developed model using various performance indicators such as  precision , recall,  F1-Score, ROC and AUC.
    
    iv. To deploy the model in an interactive web application to test the application in other environment.
